/*
Exercise 2

Consider a record E defined by two pieces of information:
- T: an array of integers that can contain a maximum of 100 elements.
- N: the number of elements of the array T.

Given a character string M, write a parameterized action that returns a record of type E 
containing all the positions of the string "ab" in the string M.

Using the Find parameterized action, write an algorithm to remove all occurrences of the string "ab".

Example:
M = "faabaababbaabrs"

Result:

Positions: [ 3, 6, 8, 12 ]
Count: 4
